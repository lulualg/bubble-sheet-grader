A bubble sheet grading system built on Python using NumPy and OpenCV.
This program was built to allow educators easy and free access to automated grading systems without the hassle of rigorous time-consuming grading.

## Instructions
Simply download all .png files and run the main.py file, making sure the .png files are located in the same folder. Don't forget to install the NumPy and OpenCV "cv2" plug-ins... Leave the rest to me!!
